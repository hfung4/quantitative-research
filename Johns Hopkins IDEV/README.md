# Johns Hopkins IDEV

- This folder contains several projects that I did during my graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

## Projects

  - **"evaluation_proposal_to_TechnoServe"**:  In 2020, I was contract with two other colleagues by TechnoServe, an international nonprofit organization that promotes business solutions to poverty in the developing world, to perform an impact evaluation of a development program called WARDA.

      - The Womenâ€™s Advancement in Rural Development & Agriculture (WARDA) is a women economic empowerment program that aims to promote participation of women smallholder farmers (SHFs) in the agricultural markets across Bihar, India.
      - Due to the lack of pre-test data and a comparison group, instead of evaluating the causal impact of the program (which was not possible), we proposed a qualitative study and process evaluation of the program (using both primary and secondary data).  Details of the proposal can be found in the final report: "Proposal_WARDA_Evaluation.pdf".

  - **"Impact Evaluation Proposal for the Lea Toto Program"**: A final project for my Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) course.  I proposed a mixed-method study to evaluate the impact of the Lea Toto Program-- a community program in Nairobi that aims to improve the quality of life of children (age 0-19) living with HIV.  The aim of this program is to reduce the prevalence of HIV death, improve the treatment of HIV-positive children in the community, and increase their psychological well-being through clinical services, social worker visits, and skills workshops.

      - The details of my proposed mixed method study on the impact of the Lea Toto program can be found in "Impact Evaluation Proposal for the Lea Toto Program.pdf"

  - **"review_of_journal_articles_on_program_evaluation":**  I reviewed two papers: a quantitative study and a qualitative study on the impact of unconditional cash transfer (UCT) on impoverished households in rural South Africa.
